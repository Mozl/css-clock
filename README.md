## My Approach

I started off seeing what I would be making in the end so watched the tutorial from start to finish. I then set about watching it again and set up my project files. I decided to separate the css and js from the html so it was easier to manage them. In terms of the CSS I liked the transition-timing-function, which makes the traditional tick of the second hand, moving slightly further ahead then moving back to the correct position each tick. I then worked on the JavaScript, selecting the hands individually and adding movement to them based on the time.
